I'm a beginner front-end developer. I finished the first stage of my studies at the Ucode IT Academy and continue to expand my knowledge in this area.


Before that, I worked as a make-up artist and had an opportunity to develop various skills. I pay a lot of attention to details, can rationally distribute tasks depending on the degree of importance and deadlines and what's not unimportant, I can find a common language with very different people.
I believe that skills that I got working in a previous field can be my advantage in a new job. 

Now my goal is to study the new area of knowledge as deeply as possible and become a truly good specialist in order to realize myself through this profession.
